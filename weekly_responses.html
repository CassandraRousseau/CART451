<h2>CART451 - Weekly Responses</h2>
<div>
<h3>Week 02 : Bio</h3>
<p>I'm Cassandra Rousseau. I am a fourth-year student in Specialization in Computation Arts, and completing a minor in Theatre. I focus my studies in video game development and art directing.  I consider myself as a multidisciplinary and interdisciplinary artist. Apart from my academics, I am also a dancer. I am a member of the dance company named <i><a href="https://en.fiercemtl.ca/" target="_blank">FierceMTL</a></i>. I perform at dance conventions and events such as <i>Montreal Salsa Congress</i> and <i><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPfcABxG-fQ&ab_channel=salsamaniacs" target="_blank">Samedi Piste Verdun</a></i>. My goal as an artist is to explore the potential combinations of all these practices to create unique storytellings and experiences. <i><a href="https://youtu.be/gZ-jzSkI8gU" target="_blank">Scenes of 74 Years</a></i> is an example of this exploration. This VR play is a prototype aiming to create an immersive theatrical production by telling the story of <i><a href="https://www.bloomsbury.com/us/scenes-from-68-years-9781474298162/" target="_blank">Scenes of 68* Years</a></i>, Khalil’s play about the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. This project was made in collaboration with the Palestinian Theatre alumni Nawash Masri.

<div><h2>Week 04: Crowdsourcing</h2><p>After the readings for week 03 and week 04, I think my understanding of crowdsourcing got clearer. Crowdsourcing is asking strangers on the Internet to engage and participate in the realization of an online collaborative project. One of the projects that I think is closer to the concept of McCarthy’s social turkers project is Exhausting a Crowd. Exhausting a Crowd is a project about watching individuals doing actions in their daily lives in public spaces. Its similarities come from watching people doing things that are part of their daily lives like McCarthy streaming her romantic dates on the Internet. Still, instead of providing the upcoming actions or dialogues to the streamed person (i.e., in social turkers’ context it was the artist), users are guessing what people are doing in public spaces around the world streamed on the artist’s website.  In McCarthy’s project, the collaborators were more serious about the answers provided during the artist's dates. In Exhausting a Crowd, collaborators make more foolish descriptions on the website (e.g., someone wrote a comment in the sky of Saint-Brieuc about the coronavirus looking for a friend). I think this detachment is coming from the level of consequences it can have on the person on the screen. Writing foolish comments on streamed recordings of crowds does not have the same impact as giving someone instructions during a romantic date. </p></div>
