<h2>CART451 - Weekly Responses</h2>
<h3>Week 02 : Bio</h3>
<p>I'm Cassandra Rousseau. I am a fourth-year student in Specialization in Computation Arts, and completing a minor in Theatre. I focus my studies in video game development and art directing.  I consider myself as a multidisciplinary and interdisciplinary artist. Apart from my academics, I am also a dancer. I am a member of the dance company named <i><a href="https://en.fiercemtl.ca/" target="_blank">FierceMTL</a></i>. I perform at dance conventions and events such as <i>Montreal Salsa Congress</i> and <i><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPfcABxG-fQ&ab_channel=salsamaniacs" target="_blank">Samedi Piste Verdun</a></i>. My goal as an artist is to explore the potential combinations of all these practices to create unique storytellings and experiences. <i><a href="https://youtu.be/gZ-jzSkI8gU" target="_blank">Scenes of 74 Years</a></i> is an example of this exploration. This VR play is a prototype aiming to create an immersive theatrical production by telling the story of <i><a href="https://www.bloomsbury.com/us/scenes-from-68-years-9781474298162/" target="_blank">Scenes of 68* Years</a></i>, Khalilâ€™s play about the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. This project was made in collaboration with the Palestinian theatre alumni Nawash Masri.
