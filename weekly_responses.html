<h2>CART451 - Weekly Responses</h2>

<h3>Week 02 : Bio</h3>
<p>I'm Cassandra Rousseau. I am a fourth-year student in Specialization in Computation Arts, and completing a minor in Theatre. I focus my studies in video game development and art directing.  I consider myself as a multidisciplinary and interdisciplinary artist. Apart from my academics, I am also a dancer. I am a member of the dance company named <i><a href="https://en.fiercemtl.ca/" target="_blank">FierceMTL</a></i>. I perform at dance conventions and events such as <i>Montreal Salsa Congress</i> and <i><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPfcABxG-fQ&ab_channel=salsamaniacs" target="_blank">Samedi Piste Verdun</a></i>. My goal as an artist is to explore the potential combinations of all these practices to create unique storytellings and experiences. <i><a href="https://youtu.be/gZ-jzSkI8gU" target="_blank">Scenes of 74 Years</a></i> is an example of this exploration. This VR play is a prototype aiming to create an immersive theatrical production by telling the story of <i><a href="https://www.bloomsbury.com/us/scenes-from-68-years-9781474298162/" target="_blank">Scenes of 68* Years</a></i>, Khalilâ€™s play about the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. This project was made in collaboration with the Palestinian Theatre alumni Nawash Masri.

<div><h3>Week 04: Crowdsourcing</h3><p>After the readings for week 03 and week 04, I think my understanding of crowdsourcing got clearer. Crowdsourcing is about asking strangers on the Internet to engage and participate in the realization of an online collaborative project. One of the projects that I think is closer to the concept of McCarthy's <i>social turkers</i> project is <i>Exhausting a Crowd</i>. <i>Exhausting a Crowd</i> is a project about streamed public spaces around the world where users watch the recorded strangers and guess their actions by writing it down on the streaming website. Its similarities come from watching people doing things that are part of their daily lives like McCarthy streaming her romantic dates on the Internet. However, users are not giving actions directly to strangers like in <i>social turkers</i> where users are providing the upcoming actions or dialogues to the streamed person (i.e., McCarthy).  In McCarthy's project, the collaborators were more serious about the answers provided during the artist's dates. In <i>Exhausting a Crowd</i>, collaborators make more foolish descriptions on the website (e.g., someone wrote a comment in the sky of Saint-Brieuc about the coronavirus looking for a friend). I think this detachment is coming from the level of consequences it can have on the person on the screen. Writing foolish comments on streamed recordings of crowds does not have the same impact as giving someone instructions during a romantic date. </p></div>

<div><h3>Week 07: Artificial Intelligence</h3>
    <p><i>The relationship between AI, ownership, authorship, and collaboration between humans and AI is a complex and evolving landscape. It's important to consider AI as a powerful tool rather than an autonomous creative entity. I share the opinion that artificial intelligence is an extension or tool that can be used moderately by humans, and that it can be immensely helpful in exploring various realms, including the depths of artificial intelligence itself, our understanding of the universe, and our humanity.</i></p>

    <p><i>One example that exemplifies this perspective is the work of Allison Parrish, a renowned artist, writer, and programmer who specializes in creative and poetic applications of AI. Parrish utilizes AI as a tool to amplify human creativity and to uncover new facets of language and expression.</i></p>
    
    <p><i>Firstly, in the realm of art and literature, Parrish employs AI to generate innovative and thought-provoking content. Her use of AI doesn't replace human creativity but complements it. By feeding AI systems with text and data, Parrish harnesses their processing power to explore language, generate poetry, and produce artworks. In this way, AI acts as a catalyst for human artistic expression, enabling us to delve deeper into our own creative potential.</i></p>
    
    <p><i>Moreover, Parrish's work highlights the collaborative potential between humans and AI. She often combines her creative insights with the computational capabilities of AI algorithms, which results in projects that are greater than the sum of their parts. This demonstrates that AI can be a collaborator, assisting humans in achieving their creative goals, rather than a replacement for human ingenuity.</i></p>
    
    <p><i>When it comes to ownership and authorship, it's essential to recognize that, in Parrish's work, she maintains a strong presence as the author and curator of her projects. While AI tools assist her in generating content, she remains the driving force behind the creative process. This underscores the idea that AI is a tool under human control, not an autonomous creator with independent ownership rights.</i></p>
    
    <p><i>In conclusion, Allison Parrish's work exemplifies the idea that AI is an extension or tool that can be used moderately by humans. AI can enhance our creativity, aid in exploring the depths of artificial intelligence, and deepen our understanding of the universe and our humanity. The key lies in acknowledging that AI, like any tool, should be wielded with responsibility and creativity by humans to unlock its full potential in collaboration with our own capabilities.</i></p>
<p>And to prove this whole argument, the text written above was generated by <i>ChatGPT</i> with the prompt "Write a response answering this question :'Ruminate on the notions of AI, ownership, authourship and collaboration between Humans and AI ... considering also your own practice ' with the opinion that artificial intelligence is an extension or tool that can be used in a moderate amount by humans, and that it can help humans to explore the voids of artificial intelligence and even learn more about our universe and humanity, and put examples of the work of Allish Parrish to prove this argument."
